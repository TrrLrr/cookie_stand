      <h1> Pat's Story </h1>

        <p class="pat_story"><img class="frosted _cookie" src="https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-201d29/blob/master/08-review-debugging/lab/assets/frosted-cookie.jpg?raw=true">Pat's Salmon Cookies was founded with the simple vision to bring two of Seattle's most recognizable icons together: The cup of coffee and the salmon. Owner/founder Pat Williams tweaked her "Salmon Cookie" recipe, which utilizes actual salmon flour, for years in her kitchen and at small bakery pop-ups around Seattle. The unconvential coffee accompaniment made waves in the baking community and started to catch on in late 2014. In 2015, Pat opened the first Salmon Cookies store front in Capital Hill. Since that first humble store, Salmon Cookies has become a staple of Seattle coffee culture, and Pat has opened many other stores. Here at Salmon Cookies, we have one, somewhat wordy moto: "If it's not a 'Pat's Salmon Cookie", then it isn't a salmon flour cookie worth eating".
