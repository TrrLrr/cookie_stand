# Today I Learned...

The things that struck me most about today weren't necessarily about the concepts of
code or programming, but rather the process of creating it. I found it very helpful to step away
from the screen, and write out my code on paper when I felt like I was stuck. This really
forced me to focus on the logic, and think about WHY my code would behave a certain way. I also
spent a lot more time talking to fellow class mates, bouncing ideas off each other, and helping them with things I'd already gotten a handle of. I found that talking through a problem would often reveal the answer to the problem I was having.
