# Today I Learned...

Dec 11: The things that struck me most about today weren't necessarily about the concepts of
code or programming, but rather the process of creating it. I found it very helpful to step away
from the screen, and write out my code on paper when I felt like I was stuck. This really
forced me to focus on the logic, and think about WHY my code would behave a certain way. I also
spent a lot more time talking to fellow class mates, bouncing ideas off each other, and helping them with things I'd already gotten a handle of. I found that talking through a problem would often reveal the answer to the problem I was having.

Dec 12: Today was another great day for collaboration and group problem solving. Even after lab, trouble shooting and talking with other students via slack proved invaluable. The biggest breakthrough today was reaching a better understand of the DOM, and the value of constructor functions. Also, it seems silly, but the importance and usefulness of proper and thorough commenting within my code became very apparent. After adding comments and dividers to my JS files, it was alot easier to jump back in to quickly and easily figure out where I was and What I was working on.

Dec 13: Learning how the JS interpreter runs and handles the code helped me understand how to structure things more effectively. Debugging was a great topic to get into also, as most of the problems I've encountered are spelling and syntax issues. It was a good day to stew over what we'd been over the last two days.

Dec 14: Today was probably the most exciting day so far, because it was the most confident I've felt going into lab. It was also exciting because the things we learned about forms and events seem to expand the scope of applications we're able to create. It was also the most time I've spent with CSS so far, which feels a little more breezy and fun compared to what we've learned so far, although I'm sure it gets just as crazy.
